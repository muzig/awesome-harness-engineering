# Awesome Harness Engineering [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of articles, playbooks, benchmarks, specifications, and open-source projects for harness engineering: the practice of shaping the environment around AI agents so they can work reliably.

Harness engineering sits at the intersection of context engineering, evaluation, observability, orchestration, safe autonomy, and software architecture. This list focuses on resources that make agents more dependable in real workflows, especially long-running coding and research tasks.

Generic agent tooling is out of scope unless the page directly covers harness design, context management, evaluation, runtime control, or other reliability-critical harness primitives.
